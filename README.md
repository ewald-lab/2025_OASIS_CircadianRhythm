# 2025_OASIS_CircadianRhythm
Repository to analyse the Cell Painting assay with co-administration of chemical perturbations and dexamethasone. 

The hypothesis is that synchronizing the circadian rhythm of the cells will make compound mode-of-actions more detectable. We test this by adding dexamethasone (a GR agonist) along with the compounds of interest in full dose-response series. We measure the same perturbations but without dexamethasone. We check two things:

1) Is the point-of-departure lower for dexamethasone co-treated samples?
2) Do different replicates and concentrations of the same compound cluster together better with co-treatment?

If our hypothesis is true, then we expect the answers to both of these questions to be yes. If both are yes, we'd want more specific follow ups to better understand what's going on.
